                My story
                I started my design career in Rotterdam. Where I studied: Communication and Multimedia Design at the University of Applied Sciences. I loved designing things, so I started a YouTube channel to improve my skills. This forced me to create something new every week and made me a little bit better with every video.I had heard of WordPress before but never really dug into it. This changed when I decided that I was time to broaden my skills so I could make my design projects come to live in websites.</p>
